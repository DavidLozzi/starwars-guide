    <p><p>Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt, was a powerful crime lord of the Hutt cartel who ruled the desert planet Tatooine from his palace in Mos Eisley. Born around ~600 BBY into House Desilijic, Jabba rose through underworld ranks to dominate smuggling, slavery, and spice trafficking across the Outer Rim. His blend of brutal enforcement and lavish hospitality kept rival syndicates in check while attracting bounty hunters and mercenaries to his court. Over centuries he amassed wealth and influence, famously negotiating passage fees during the Naboo blockade, attempting to recruit a young Han Solo, freezing Solo in carbonite as bounty payment, and enslaving Princess Leia. Jabba’s reign ended in 4 ABY when Leia killed him at the Great Pit of Carkoon during the Battle of the Sarlacc, triggering power struggles within Hutt-controlled territories.</p></p>
