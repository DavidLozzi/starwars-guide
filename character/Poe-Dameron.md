    <p><p>Poe Dameron is a skilled New Republic and Resistance pilot, celebrated for his expertise in T-70 X-wing starfighters and leadership within Black Squadron. Born to Rebellion heroes and orphaned at a young age, he rose through the ranks as a test pilot and flight instructor before joining the Resistance under General Leia Organa. Dameron’s daring missions include retrieving the droid BB-8 from the desert world Jakku, leading strikes against the First Order’s Starkiller Base, pivotal engagements at the Battle of D’Qar and on Crait, and key operations in the conflict against the Final Order. His bravery and tactical acumen establish him as one of the Resistance’s most prominent figures, culminating in his promotion to General by the time of the galaxy’s final confrontation on Exegol.</p></p>
