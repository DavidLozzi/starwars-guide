    Rex (CT-7567)             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Rex?year=-32" target="_blank">32 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p><p>Captain Rex, born CT-7567, is a seasoned clone trooper officer in the Grand Army of the Republic renowned for his unwavering loyalty to Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano and his exemplary command of the 501st Legion during the Clone Wars. He distinguished himself in pivotal battles such as Christophsis, Umbara, Mygeeto and the defense of Kamino, and when Order 66 activated his inhibitor chip he resisted its control to rescue Ahsoka. After the war he faked his death and lived in exile on Seelos, only to reemerge years later to fight alongside Sabine Wren, Ezra Bridger and the rest of the Ghost crew in the early days of the Rebel Alliance, taking part in key actions on Malachor and the Siege of Lothal. Throughout his service, Rex embodied the courage and camaraderie of the clone army and played a crucial role in the Republic’s transformation into the Rebellion.</p></p>
