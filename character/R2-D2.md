    R2-D2             
    </p>

    <p><p>R2-D2 is a resourceful astromech droid renowned for his bold personality and versatile array of tools, serving across the galaxy’s defining conflicts. Beginning life as a maintenance unit aboard Queen Amidala’s Royal Starship, he later became the loyal companion of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, survived the purge of the Jedi, and joined the Rebel Alliance. R2-D2 was instrumental in recovering the Death Star plans and contributed to pivotal victories at Yavin, Hoth, Bespin and Endor. Decades later he aided the Resistance against the First Order at Starkiller Base and the Sith on Exegol, cementing his legacy as one of the galaxy’s most celebrated heroes.</p></p>
