    Ben Solo (Kylo Ren)     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Ben Solo?year=5" target="_blank">5 ABY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Ben Solo?year=35" target="_blank">35 ABY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa and nephew of Luke Skywalker, was born into the legendary Skywalker-Solo lineage and trained as a Jedi under his uncle. Corrupted by Supreme Leader Snoke and driven by his own inner turmoil, he destroyed Luke’s fledgling Jedi temple and adopted the dark identity of Kylo Ren, rising to lead the Knights of Ren and ultimately the First Order. Wielding a distinctive crossguard lightsaber, he orchestrated the destruction of the Hosnian system, fatally struck down his father, and betrayed Snoke to seize supreme power. His complex bond and battles with the scavenger Rey, coupled with moments of doubt and conflict, culminated in his redemption on Exegol, where he renounced the Dark Side, reclaimed his identity as Ben Solo, and sacrificed his life to save Rey.</p></p>
