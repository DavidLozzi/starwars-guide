    <p><p>Count Dooku, also known by his Sith name Darth Tyranus, is a human noble from Serenno who rose to become a respected Jedi Master before secretly embracing the dark side. He is best known for abandoning the Jedi Order, serving as the apprentice of Darth Sidious, and founding the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which sparked the Clone Wars. Major milestones in his life include his Jedi training and mastery, resignation to pursue Sith ambitions, orchestration of the Separatist movement, leading key battles such as Geonosis, and ultimately his demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker during the war.</p></p>
