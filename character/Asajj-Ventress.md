    </p>

    <p><p>Asajj Ventress is a Dathomiran Force-sensitive Nightsister who was taken from her clan and trained as a Sith apprentice by Count Dooku during the Clone Wars. Known for wielding twin red lightsabers and her ruthless combat tactics, she rose to prominence as a commander of the Separatist droid armies and a formidable adversary of Jedi such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. After her betrayal by Dooku, she survived as an outlaw bounty hunter, briefly allied with the Black Sun syndicate, and later partnered with Jedi Quinlan Vos to assassinate her former master. In the aftermath she sought to restore her Nightsister clan on Dathomir, but was ultimately mortally wounded in a confrontation with her brother Savage Opress.</p></p>
