    Boba Fett             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Boba Fett?year=-32" target="_blank">32 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Boba Fett was a bounty hunter whose career spanned decades, from the fall of the Galactic Republic to the rise of the Galactic Empire. Originally code-named Alpha, he was an unaltered clone of the famed Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. Boba emulated his father and genetic donor by wearing a customized suit of Mandalorian armor. His personal starship was the Slave I, a Firespray-31-class patrol and attack craft that once belonged to Jango. Trained in combat and martial skills from a young age, Fett was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. He became a legend over the course of his career, which included contracts for both the Empire and the extensive criminal underworld.</p>
