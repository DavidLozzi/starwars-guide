    Boba Fett             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Boba Fett?year=-32" target="_blank">32 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p><p>Boba Fett is a notorious Mandalorian bounty hunter in the Star Wars galaxy, known for his distinctive beskar armor, jetpack, and reputation for ruthless efficiency. Born as the unaltered clone of the legendary mercenary Jango Fett on Kamino, he witnessed his father’s death at the Battle of Geonosis and embarked on a solo career capturing high-value targets during the Clone Wars. Employed by the Empire and notorious crime lords, Fett famously delivered Han Solo frozen in carbonite to Jabba the Hutt, survived the Great Pit of Carkoon, and ultimately returned to Tatooine to claim the legacy of Jabba’s criminal empire, ruling Mos Espa alongside his ally Fennec Shand.</p></p>
