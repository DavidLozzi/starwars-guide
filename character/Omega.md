    <p>Omega was an unaltered, yet enhanced clone created from the genetic template of the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett who lived in the years following the Clone Wars. Originally created as a pure genetic replication of Fett, she was a medical assistant to Nala Se and spent her days working in Tipoca City on the clone homeworld of Kamino. When the war ended, she took an interest in Clone Force 99, who had returned from a battle on Kaller. Later, when Wilhuff Tarkin arrived on Kamino to assess the clone troopers, she joined Clone Force 99 and escaped Kamino.</p>
