    Omega             
    </p>

    <p><p>Omega is the first unaltered female clone of Jango Fett, genetically engineered on Kamino and raised in secret laboratories during the Clone Wars. Known for her exceptional intelligence, medical aptitude, and deep empathy for her fellow clones, she is discovered and rescued by Clone Force 99 as the Republic falls and the Empire rises. Adopting the code name “Omega,” she joins the Bad Batch on a series of daring missions across the galaxy—defending Ferrix, repairing starships on Bracca, liberating undeveloped clones on Kamino, and aiding uprisings on Ryloth and Onderon. After being captured and experimented on by her brother Crosshair on Polis Massa, Omega escapes, continuing to support clandestine operations against the Empire and laying the foundations of the Rebel Alliance.</p></p>
