    Cad Bane     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Cad Bane?year=-62" target="_blank">62 BBY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Cad Bane?year=9" target="_blank">9 ABY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Cad Bane is a legendary Duros bounty hunter renowned for his cold efficiency, cunning tactics and willingness to take on the Empire’s toughest contracts. Rising to prominence during the Clone Wars, he executed high-stakes missions for Count Dooku and Darth Sidious—sabotaging General Grievous’s flagship, seizing hostages in the Jedi Temple, and freeing Ziro the Hutt from prison—while repeatedly outwitting the Jedi. After surviving Order 66, he continued his underworld career throughout the early Imperial era, clashing with rival hunters in the Bounty Hunter Wars, resurfacing briefly in galactic conflicts and eventually crossing paths with Boba Fett in the wake of Return of the Jedi. His career remains marked by daring heists, narrow escapes and a reputation as one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy.</p></p>
