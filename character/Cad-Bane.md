    <p>Cad Bane was a bounty hunter in the galaxy during the Clone Wars. He was considered the best and one of the most experienced bounty hunters in the galaxy during the Clone Wars due to the death of Jango Fett at the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY. Although his infamy grew during the Clone Wars in particular, Bane had a high standing amongst other bounty hunters, working with the likes of Aurra Sing years before the onset of the war. He even had a temporary alliance with the Sith Lord Darth Maul. He specialized in fighting Jedi and dueled with some of the most skilled Jedi during the Clone Wars, including Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. His reputation led him to be repeatedly hired by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, working for him on numerous projects, including infiltrating the Jedi Temple to steal a kyber memory crystal containing a list of Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy. He died at the hands of Boba Fett.</p>
