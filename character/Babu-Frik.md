    </p>

    <p><p>Babu Frik is an Anzellan droidsmith and tech savant from the mountainous world of Kijimi, renowned for his diminutive stature, quick wit and unparalleled expertise in reprogramming and translating droid software. He earned his reputation by crafting microcircuit modifications for local crime syndicates and maintaining a bustling workshop in Suod, where he honed his skill at extracting and rewriting droid memory. His most famous achievement came in 35 ABY when he aided Rey, Finn and Poe in decoding the inscription on a Sith dagger by resetting C-3PO’s memory banks under severe time pressure and later restoring the protocol droid’s original persona. This pivotal service solidified his status as a clandestine hero of the Resistance and a galaxy-wide expert on droid lore.</p></p>
