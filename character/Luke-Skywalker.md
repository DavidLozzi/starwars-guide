    <p><p>Luke Skywalker is a legendary Jedi Knight in the Star Wars saga, the son of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala who is raised on Tatooine before answering the call to adventure with the Rebel Alliance. He is best known for wielding his father’s lightsaber, aiding in the destruction of the first Death Star, and ultimately redeeming Darth Vader to bring down Emperor Palpatine. Trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, he plays a central role in ending the Galactic Civil War, later founding the New Jedi Order, marrying former Emperor’s Hand Mara Jade, and guiding a new generation of Force-sensitive students. Luke leads the Jedi to victory in the Yuuzhan Vong War and makes a final, galaxy-wide Force projection to aid the Resistance, sacrificing himself and passing fully into the Force as one of the most influential figures in galactic history.</p></p>
