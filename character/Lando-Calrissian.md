    </p>

    <p><p>Landonis Balthazar Calrissian is a charismatic human male known for his smooth-talking charm, daring exploits as a gambler and scoundrel, and his later role as a Rebel Alliance hero and New Republic leader. Born on the mining colony of Socorro, he rose to prominence by winning Pazaak tournaments and captaining his own starship before accepting appointment as Baron Administrator of Cloud City. Initially betraying Han Solo to Darth Vader, Calrissian quickly redeemed himself by joining the Alliance, leading crucial strikes in the Battle of Endor and participating in the rescue of Solo, ultimately earning the rank of general. After the fall of the Empire he served in several high-level administrative and exploratory capacities for the New Republic and later returned to aid the Resistance in its final stand against the First Order.</p>
