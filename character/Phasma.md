    Phasma     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Phasma?year=6" target="_blank">6 ABY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Phasma?year=34" target="_blank">34 ABY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Captain Phasma, born on the junk world of Parnassos, is the First Orders elite stormtrooper officer renowned for her reflective chromium armor, strategic ruthlessness and unwavering loyalty to Supreme Leader Snoke. Rising from enslavement and scavenging childhood, she excelled at the First Orders training academies, ultimately receiving command of the Star Destroyer Finalizer and the 91st Stormtrooper Corps. Phasma played a central role in the assault on Hosnian Prime, the pursuit and capture of Resistance operatives Finn and Poe Dameron on Jakku, and the Battle of Crait, where she was presumed killed after the Finalizers downing. Surviving her fall, she resurfaces in the First Orders fleet, continuing to enforce its iron will across the galaxy.</p></p>
