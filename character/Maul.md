    Maul (Darth)     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Maul?year=-54" target="_blank">54 BBY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Maul?year=-2" target="_blank">2 BBY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p>Maul, once known as Darth Maul, established himself as a crime lord during the reign of the Galactic Empire. However, he was once the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.</p>
