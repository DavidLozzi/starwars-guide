    Maul (Darth)     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Maul?year=-54" target="_blank">54 BBY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Maul?year=-2" target="_blank">2 BBY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Darth Maul is a fearsome Dathomirian Zabrak who became the Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious, renowned for his horned visage, his red double-bladed lightsaber, and mastery of ferocious combat. Discovered as a child for his raw connection to the Force, he was trained in the dark side to serve as Sidious’s secret weapon against the Jedi. Maul rose to infamy at the Battle of Naboo, where he killed Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn before being struck down and presumed dead by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Defying death, he was resurrected with cybernetic legs and carved out a criminal empire as leader of the Shadow Collective, waging vendettas against both Sith and Jedi during the Clone Wars and beyond. Ultimately, he met his fate on Tatooine while confronting his old rival, sacrificing himself to protect his new apprentice and finally ending his long quest for revenge.</p></p>
