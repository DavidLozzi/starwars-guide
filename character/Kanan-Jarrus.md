    <p><p>Caleb Dume, better known as Kanan Jarrus, is a Jedi survivor of Order 66 who became a key agent of the early Rebel Alliance. Trained as a Padawan under Master Depa Billaba during the Clone Wars, he survived the Empire’s purge by going into hiding and later reemerged as the pilot and de facto leader of the starship Ghost’s Phoenix Squadron. Known for secretly training the Force-sensitive street orphan Ezra Bridger, he helped forge the foundations of the Rebellion through daring missions against Imperial forces. His journey culminated at the Battle of Atollon, where he sacrificed himself to protect his friends and ensured his legacy lived on in the Alliance.</p></p>
