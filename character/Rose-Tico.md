    Rose Tico             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Rose Tico?year=11" target="_blank">11 ABY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Rose Tico served in the Resistance as a maintenance worker during their conflict with the First Order, whom Tico had hated since she was a child. Tico's older sister, Paige, was a gunner in the Resistance. Following the Battle of D'Qar, in which her sister was killed, and during the First Order's attack on the Resistance fleet, Tico, former Stormtrooper Finn, and astromech unit BB-8 arrived on the city of Canto Bight to recruit the &quot;Master Codebreaker,&quot; hoping he could disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker. Instead allying with criminal DJ, the four were captured before they could disable the tracker and betrayed by DJ. In the ensuing Battle of Crait, Tico saved Finn's life and, although unconscious, was among the members of the Resistance who escaped aboard the Millennium Falcon.</p>
