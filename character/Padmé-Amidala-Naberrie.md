    <p><p>Padmé Amidala, born Padmé Naberrie on the planet Naboo, rose from handmaiden to become her world’s young queen and later its senator in the Galactic Republic. Renowned for her diplomatic skill and unwavering commitment to justice, she orchestrated the liberation of Naboo from the Trade Federation, sowed seeds of peace during the Clone Wars, and tirelessly defended democratic ideals in the Senate. As a close ally and secret wife of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, she balanced her duties with personal devotion, leading critical negotiations on worlds like Ryloth and Skako Minor and challenging the consolidation of power by Chancellor Palpatine. Her life ended tragically on Polis Massa, where she gave birth to twins Luke and Leia before passing away, leaving a legacy that would shape the galaxy’s destiny.</p></p>
