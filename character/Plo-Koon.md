    <p><p>Plo Koon was a Kel Dor Jedi Master from the planet Dorin, renowned for his calm, analytical nature, distinctive goggles and rebreather mask, and his unwavering sense of justice. Rising through the ranks of the Jedi Order, he served as a respected Jedi Guardian and later as a member of the Jedi High Council, playing pivotal roles in key battles throughout the Clone Wars. He is best known for discovering Ahsoka Tano and bringing her to the Order, advocating for the Republic's clone army, and demonstrating exceptional leadership on battlefields like Christophsis and Umbara. His distinguished service ended tragically in ~19 BBY when he fell victim to Order 66 and was killed by his clone troopers.</p></p>
