    Thrawn (Mitth'raw' nuruodo)             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Thrawn?year=-59" target="_blank">59 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p><p>Grand Admiral Thrawn, born Mitth'raw'nuruodo, is a legendary Chiss tactician renowned for his uncanny ability to predict enemy movements by studying their art and culture. He clandestinely left the Chiss Ascendancy to join the Galactic Empire’s naval ranks, rising rapidly through the Imperial Academy to become the Empire’s only non-human Grand Admiral. Thrawn commanded the Third Fleet in crushing campaigns against non-human insurgents and pirates, orchestrated the Siege of Lothal against the Rebel Alliance’s Phoenix Squadron, and was presumed lost after the Battle of Endor. In Legends he later reemerged to challenge the New Republic, while in current canon he resurfaced in the Unknown Regions to defend Chiss interests, forge uneasy alliances, and set the stage for future galactic conflicts leading toward the rise of the First Order.</p></p>
