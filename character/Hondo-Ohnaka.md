    Hondo Ohnaka             
    </p>

    <p><p>Hondo Ohnaka is a charismatic Weequay pirate lord and leader of the Ohnaka Gang, renowned for his cunning schemes, shifting alliances and roguish sense of humor.  Over centuries he carved out a profitable career in the Outer Rim, first rising to prominence during the Mandalorian Wars and later playing both sides in the Clone Wars—at various times capturing Jedi, smuggling for the Confederacy and aiding the Republic.  After the fall of the Republic he continued his piratical exploits, engaging Rebel operatives on Florrum and eventually crossing paths with the New Republic era’s Din Djarin and Cob Vanth in The Mandalorian.  His daring plots, opportunistic partnerships and trademark laughter have cemented his reputation as one of the galaxy’s most resourceful and unpredictable scoundrels.</p></p>
