    <p><p>Kit Fisto is a Nautolan Jedi Master renowned for his calm demeanor, exceptional lightsaber skills and unparalleled amphibious agility. Trained within the Jedi Order from childhood, he rose to knight and became a respected Jedi General during the Clone Wars, earning distinction for his victories at Geonosis and Felucia and his heroic defense of Coruscant. A gifted duelist, he engaged repeatedly with Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress, and served briefly on the Jedi High Council. Fisto’s career ended tragically during Order 66 when clone troopers executed him in the Senate chambers alongside Mace Windu.</p></p>
