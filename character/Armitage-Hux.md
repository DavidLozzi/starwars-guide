    <p><p>Armitage Hux is a high-ranking First Order general renowned for his ruthless ambition, icy demeanor and fiery oratory that rallies troops to crush the Resistance. The son of Imperial Remnant commander Brendol Hux, he rapidly rose through the First Order’s ranks to oversee the construction and activation of the planet-destroying Starkiller Base. He ordered the annihilation of the Hosnian star system and led subsequent campaigns to hunt down the Resistance, including at Crait. In the aftermath of Supreme Leader Snoke’s fall he briefly seized control of the First Order before being betrayed and executed by Emperor Palpatine on Exegol. His legacy is defined by his cruelty, his rivalry with Kylo Ren and his role in the galaxy’s final conflict.</p></p>
