    Garazeb Orrelios (Zeb)             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Garazeb Orrelios?year=-44" target="_blank">44 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Garazeb Orrelios was a rebel who manned the starship, the Ghost. Prior to joining the Spectres rebel cell, Orrelios was a Captain of the Lasan Honor Guard and was trained to fight with a bo-rifle. He was one of the few Lasat to survive the devastation of his homeworld of Lasan and as a result developed a deep hatred towards the Empire. As a member of the Lothal rebel cell led by the Twi'lek Hera Syndulla and the Jedi Kanan Jarrus, Orrelios took part in numerous raids and missions against the Empire. While temperamental and volatile, Zeb was compassionate and had a strong moral compass.</p>
