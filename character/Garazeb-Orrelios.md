Renowned for his raw strength, loyalty, and distinctive bo-rifle, Zeb survived the Empire’s genocide of Lasan and supported key operations such as the liberation of Lothal, the defense of the Atollon base, and the daring mission to Dathomir. Throughout his journey from gladiatorial captive to Rebel General, he reconciled his warrior heritage with newfound purpose, returning to free his homeworld and ultimately serving the fledgling New Republic.</p></p>
