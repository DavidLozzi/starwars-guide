    <p><p>Cassian Jeron Andor is a human intelligence officer and operative for the Alliance to Restore the Republic, renowned for his resourcefulness, undercover expertise, and unwavering dedication to the Rebel cause. Orphaned after a raid on his homeworld in the Kenari system, he was raised by his adoptive mother on the industrial planet Ferrix before serving as an informant for the Imperial Security Bureau. Disillusioned by Imperial atrocities, he defected to the burgeoning Rebellion, undertaking numerous clandestine missions alongside operatives such as Vel Sartha, K-2SO, and Luthen Rael. His most pivotal contribution came during the Battle of Scarif, where he led a team to steal and transmit the Death Star plans, sacrificing himself to secure a decisive victory that would ultimately enable the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire’s ultimate weapon.</p></p>
