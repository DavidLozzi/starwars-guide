    </p>

    <p><p>Nute Gunray was a Neimoidian statesman who rose to serve as Viceroy of the Trade Federation, infamous for orchestrating the 32 BBY naval blockade and invasion of Naboo at the behest of the Sith. Known for his political cunning and allegiance to Darth Sidious, he later became a founding member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems and sat on its Separatist Council throughout the Clone Wars. His career spanned covert negotiations, military engagements across the galaxy, and a failed assassination plot against Chancellor Palpatine, culminating in his execution on Mustafar by Darth Vader in 19 BBY.</p></p>
