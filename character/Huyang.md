    </p>

    <p><p>Huyang is an ancient architectural and technical droid who served the Jedi Order for over seven thousand years, renowned for his expertise in designing and constructing lightsabers and his role as a guide and mentor to generations of Jedi younglings. He assisted younglings in forging their first lightsabers on Ilum during the Clone Wars, providing instruction and testing their resolve in the trials of the Kyber crystal. Vanishing after the fall of the Republic, he later reappears in the Outer Rim on Lothal, where he aids Sabine Wren as she embraces the Way of the Jedi and forges her own saber, continuing his legacy as a custodian of Jedi lore and tradition.</p></p>
