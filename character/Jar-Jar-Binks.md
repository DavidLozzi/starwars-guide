    Jar Jar Binks             
    </p>

    <p><p>Jar Jar Binks is a Gungan from the underwater city of Otoh Gunga on the planet Naboo. Known for his exaggerated clumsiness, distinctive speech and role as comic relief, he first befriends Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Trade Federation’s blockade of Naboo. His pivotal actions in the Battle of Naboo help secure victory for the Gungan Grand Army and Naboo loyalists, earning him a seat as his people’s representative in the Galactic Senate. As senator, Jar Jar plays an unwitting yet critical role in the rise of Emperor Palpatine by granting emergency powers at the onset of the Clone Wars. Following the fall of the Republic, he retreats into exile on Naboo under an assumed identity, remaining in hiding through the Imperial era and sparking rumors of a possible return during the New Republic and beyond.</p></p>
