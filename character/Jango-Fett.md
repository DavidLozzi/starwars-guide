    <p><p>Jango Fett was a renowned Mandalorian bounty hunter and mercenary whose combat skill and unerring aim earned him wide acclaim across the galaxy. He served as the unaltered genetic template for the Grand Army of the Republic, leading to the creation of the clone troopers, and he raised his unmodified clone son, Boba Fett, as his heir. Known for his distinctive beskar armor, dual WESTAR-34 blaster pistols and jetpack, Jango’s career climaxed during the Battle of Geonosis, where he perished in combat against the Jedi but whose legacy endured through the very army he inspired.</p></p>
