    Mon Mothma             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Mon Mothma?year=-46" target="_blank">46 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p><p>Mon Mothma is a Chandrilan aristocrat and dedicated stateswoman who served as Senator of Chandrila during the waning days of the Republic, became a founder and leader of the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire, and later helped establish and lead the New Republic. Known for her unwavering integrity, moral conviction and discreet organization of resistance cells, she famously delivered the Alliance’s rallying cry before the Battle of Yavin. Key milestones include her resignation from the Imperial Senate at the rise of Palpatine, her secret convening on Yavin 4 to unite disparate rebel cells, her orchestration of the campaign to steal the Death Star plans, her presence at the Battle of Endor and her election as the New Republic’s first Chancellor, where she championed decentralization and peace across the galaxy.</p></p>
