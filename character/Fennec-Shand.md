    Fennec Shand             
    </p>

    <p><p>Fennec Shand is a highly skilled and resourceful human mercenary and assassin known for her lethal efficiency and razor-sharp instincts. Rising from obscurity on Coruscant to become a sought-after bounty hunter, she earned a reputation for her fearsome marksmanship and tactical cunning. After a near-fatal encounter with Din Djarin on Tatooine, she was rescued and restored by Boba Fett, forging a lasting alliance with the legendary bounty hunter. As Fetts right hand, she played a pivotal role in reclaiming his legacy, rescuing Grogu, and seizing control of Mos Espa, where she now serves as a trusted lieutenant, bodyguard, and co-ruler in the burgeoning criminal enclave of Freetown.</p></p>
