    Fennec Shand             
    </p>

    <p>Fennec Shand was an assassin, mercenary, and bounty hunter, who worked for many of the top crime syndicates. During the early days of the Galactic Empire, when Clone Force 99 landed on Pantora, Shand took it upon herself to capture the clone girl Omega who had a bounty placed on her. She managed to gain Omega's trust, but betrayed Omega and her friends when clone commando sergeant Hunter came to rescue her. She fought off Wrecker, another member of Clone Force 99, and chased Omega to the top of a tower. Shand dropped Omega onto a hovertruck and followed her. Omega was able to escape her grasp and return to Hunter, but Shand vowed to continue her hunt for the girl.</p>
