    </p>

    <p><p>Maz Kanata is a centuries-old, Force-sensitive smuggler, pirate leader, treasure hunter and tavern keeper celebrated for her wide-ranging experiences and deep insight. Having studied under a Jedi master on Yavin 4 in her youth, she spent millennia traversing the galaxy as a notorious pirate queen before settling on Takodana, where she founded her famed castle and built a secret intelligence network. In the sequel era she played a vital role in aiding the Resistance—sheltering Han Solo and BB-8, guiding Rey to Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber—and later used her Force perception and contacts to help locate Emperor Palpatine and secure the final victory over the Sith.</p></p>
