    Chopper (C1-10P)             
    </p>

    <p><p>C1-10P, nicknamed "Chopper", is a cranky yet resourceful astromech droid who served aboard the Ghost for the early Rebel Alliance. Known for his cantankerous personality, inventive modifications and unwavering loyalty, he played a pivotal role in missions on Lothal, Atollon and beyond by performing critical repairs, hacking Imperial systems and offering unexpected acts of heroism. Major milestones include joining Hera Syndulla’s Rebel cell, aiding in the rescue of Jedi and fellow rebels, participating in the final Battle for Lothal—after which he remained behind when Ezra Bridger vanished—and reuniting with his crew in the New Republic era.</p></p>
