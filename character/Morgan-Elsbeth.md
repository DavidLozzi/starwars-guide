    <p><p>Morgan Elsbeth is a former high-ranking officer of the Imperial Security Bureau who, after the fall of the Empire, established herself as the ruthless Magistrate of Calodan on the planet Corvus. Known for her mastery of the Dark Side, political cunning and unyielding pursuit of Imperial remnants, she orchestrated the exile of dissidents, hired elite mercenaries like Fennec Shand, and clashed with New Republic allies, most notably in her duel against Cara Dune and Din Djarin’s companions. Captured and imprisoned by Moff Gideon during an attempt to hand over Grogu, she later resurfaced as a pivotal antagonist in the search for Grand Admiral Thrawn, challenging Ahsoka Tano in a decisive confrontation that cemented her reputation as a formidable Dark Side practitioner and power broker in the post-Imperial galaxy.</p></p>
