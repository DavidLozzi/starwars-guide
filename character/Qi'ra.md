    Qi'ra             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Qi'ra?year=-31" target="_blank">31 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Qi'ra lived during the reign of the Galactic Empire. She grew up on the streets along with Han as part of the White Worms. Though they were at first rivals, the two scrumrats eventually became lovers. Sometime after Qi'ra was made Head Girl by Lady Proxima, Han and Qi'ra attempted to escape with a vial of coaxium, but were separated at the Coronet Spaceport, with Han getting away, though he promised to return for her.</p>
