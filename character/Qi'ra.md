    <p><p>Qi’ra is a cunning Corellian survivor turned influential underworld figure, first introduced as Han Solo’s childhood friend and love interest in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Rising from the slums of Corellia, she is known for her skill in covert operations, leadership within the criminal syndicate Crimson Dawn, and her secret allegiance to Darth Maul. Major milestones in her journey include her separation from Han during an escape attempt, her recruitment and ascent to lieutenant under Dryden Vos, her pivotal role in the Coaxium heist and the Kessel Run, her ruthless elimination of Vos to seize control of Crimson Dawn, and her strategic alliance with Emperor Palpatine that cements her status as a powerful underworld matriarch.</p></p>
