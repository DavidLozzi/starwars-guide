    Mace Windu     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Mace Windu?year=-80" target="_blank">80 BBY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Mace Windu?year=-19" target="_blank">19 BBY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Mace Windu is a legendary Jedi Master celebrated for his unparalleled lightsaber prowess and mastery of the Vaapad form, marked by the distinctive purple blade he wielded. Born on the perilous world of Haruun Kal, he rose from Jedi initiate to one of the few members of the High Council who dared to challenge both Separatist ambitions and the Republic’s political inertia. A key general during the Clone Wars, Windu led Republic forces in major engagements, including Geonosis and the defense of Coruscant, and undertook the fateful mission on his homeworld that cost him his right hand. His unwavering dedication to justice ultimately led him to confront Chancellor Palpatine upon discovering his Sith identity—a final, catastrophic duel that ended Windu’s life but solidified his legacy as a paragon of Jedi virtue.</p></p>
