    <p><p>Han Solo is a charismatic Corellian smuggler turned Rebel hero, famed for piloting the Millennium Falcon and his lifelong partnership with co-pilot Chewbacca. Initially an Imperial cadet expelled for insubordination, he made his name running illicit cargoes and winning the Falcon from Lando Calrissian in a high-stakes card game. Recruited by the Rebel Alliance, he played a pivotal role in rescuing Princess Leia Organa and destroying both Death Stars, later marrying Leia and serving the New Republic. His adventurous spirit and cunning tactics cemented his legend, culminating in a final sacrifice confronting his son, Kylo Ren, to aid the Resistance against the First Order.</p></p>
