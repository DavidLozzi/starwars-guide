    </p>

    <p>Reva served the Galactic Empire as a member of the Inquisitorius during the Imperial Era, briefly serving as Grand Inquisitor. Like her fellow Inquisitors, the Third Sister was a former Jedi who turned to the dark side of the Force and was tasked with hunting the surviving members of the Jedi Order during the Great Jedi Purge. Around the year 9 BBY, the Third Sister was dispatched along with the Grand Inquisitor and the Fifth Brother to Tatooine to hunt down the Jedi Nari.</p>
