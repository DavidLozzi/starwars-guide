    Reva (Third Sister)             
    </p>

    <p><p>The Third Sister, real name Reva Sevander, is a former Jedi Temple acolyte who survived Order 66 only to be recruited and trained by Darth Vader as part of the Inquisitorius. Rising to the rank of Third Sister, she is infamous for her ruthless pursuit of Jedi survivors, especially her obsessive manhunt for Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine. Her career peaked when she captured Princess Leia Organa and forced Owen Lars to reveal Kenobi’s whereabouts, before losing her right forearm in a brutal duel beneath volcanic caverns. Ultimately, her fixation led to a final showdown at the Fortress Inquisitorius, where Vader himself executed her for her failure and insolence.</p></p>
