    </p>

    <p><p>Chewbacca is a Wookiee warrior and engineer from the forest world Kashyyyk, famed as the towering co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon and lifelong companion of Han Solo. Renowned for his immense strength, technical skill and unwavering loyalty, he first distinguished himself fighting alongside clone troopers in the Clone Wars and defending his homeworld during the Siege of Kashyyyk. After forging an unbreakable bond with Han Solo, Chewbacca aided the Rebel Alliance in pivotal battles such as Yavin, Hoth and Endor, helping to dismantle the Empire. In later years, he rejoined his friends to battle the First Order—playing key roles in the destruction of Starkiller Base, the Battle of Crait and the final defeat of the Sith on Exegol—cementing his legacy as one of the galaxy’s greatest heroes.</p></p>
