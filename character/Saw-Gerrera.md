    <p><p>Saw Gerrera is a militant freedom fighter from the jungle moon of Onderon who first gained prominence leading the Onderon uprising against the Separatists during the Clone Wars. After the rise of the Empire he founded the Partisans, an extremist rebel cell notorious for ruthless guerrilla tactics and high‐risk operations. Over decades he waged a brutal campaign against Imperial forces across the galaxy, taking a young Jyn Erso under his wing following her father’s death and operating from secret bases on Eadu and Jedha. Saw’s uncompromising approach made him both a feared adversary of the Empire and a controversial figure among mainstream rebels, and he ultimately died when the Death Star destroyed Jedha City.</p></p>
