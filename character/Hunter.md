    Hunter             
    </p>

    <p><p>Hunter is the leader of Clone Force 99, an elite clone commando unit genetically engineered on Kamino with heightened senses and expert tracking abilities. He gained renown during the Clone Wars for leading daring operations such as the Offworld mining colony rescue and Hypori covert assault, and for recovering the captured trooper Echo. When Order 66 was issued, Hunter defied Imperial orders to protect Omega, a Force-sensitive clone, and guided his squad into a new life as mercenaries. He orchestrated the liberation of Kamino from inhibitor chip production, tracked down rogue KX-series droids, and forged uneasy alliances with figures like Cid and Fennec Shand, cementing his reputation as a resourceful strategist and unwavering protector in the dawn of the Empire.</p></p>
