    <p><p>Ahsoka Tano is a Togruta Force-sensitive who trained as a Jedi Padawan under Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars, distinguishing herself in battles across the galaxy. Framed and disillusioned by the Jedi Council, she left the Order before playing a crucial role in the Siege of Mandalore and surviving Order 66. Adopting the codename Fulcrum, she provided intelligence to early Rebellion cells and later joined the Ghost crew to fight the Empire. Years after the Empire’s fall, Ahsoka aided Din Djarin in protecting Grogu and pursued her former ally Ezra Bridger, forging a legacy as a skilled warrior, diplomat, and guardian of the Force.</p></p>
