    <p><p>Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan was born on Naboo and trained as a communications technician and pilot in the Royal Naboo Navy before marrying Senator Bail Organa and becoming queen consort of Alderaan. Renowned for her compassion, diplomacy, and quiet courage, she secretly aided the nascent Rebel Alliance, provided sanctuary to those persecuted by the Empire, and lovingly raised her adoptive daughter, Leia Organa. From her early service defending freedom on Naboo to hosting critical diplomatic efforts on Alderaan and ultimately sacrificing her life when the Empire destroyed her home, Breha’s life is defined by unwavering dedication to justice, her people, and the Rebel cause.</p></p>
