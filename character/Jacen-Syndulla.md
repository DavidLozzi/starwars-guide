    </p>

    <p><p>Jacen Syndulla, the son of Rebel icons Hera Syndulla and Kanan Jarrus, is a Force-sensitive individual born aboard the Ghost II during the Galactic Civil War. Known for his legacy as one of the earliest Jedi children in the New Republic era, Jacen demonstrated latent Force abilities in his youth before being selected by Luke Skywalker to train at the restored Jedi Temple. His journey includes his birth amidst high-stakes Rebel missions, glimpsed appearances as an infant and toddler in the aftermath of the Empireâ€™s fall, formal induction as a Jedi Padawan, pivotal diplomatic assignments, successful completion of Jedi trials to attain Knight status, and his evolution into a respected Jedi Master guiding new generations of Force users.</p></p>
