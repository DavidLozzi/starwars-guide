    <p><p>Sheev Palpatine, better known as Darth Sidious, is the cunning Sith Lord who manipulated his way into power as Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic before transforming it into the tyrannical Galactic Empire. Known for orchestrating the Trade Federation’s blockade of Naboo, instigating the Clone Wars, and executing Order 66 to exterminate the Jedi, he secretly controlled both sides of the conflict to cement his rule. As Emperor Palpatine, he corrupted Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, oversaw the construction of the Death Star superweapons, and ruled with an iron fist until his apparent demise at the Battle of Endor. Through forbidden Sith alchemy, he later returned in the galaxy’s final days, only to meet his ultimate end at the hands of the Resistance.</p></p>
