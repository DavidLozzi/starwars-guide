    </p>

    <p>Sheev Palpatine, and also known simply as the Emperor, was a Dark Lord of the Sith known as Darth Sidious, and Emperor of the Galactic Empire, ruling from 19 BBY to 4 ABY. Rising to power in the Republic Senate as the senator of Naboo, the secretive Sith Lord cultivated two identities, Sidious and Palpatine, using both to further his political career. He orchestrated the fall of the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order through the Clone Wars, and then established his reign over the galaxy which lasted until his death at the Battle of Endor. However, the dark side of the Force gave rise to powers which allowed the Emperor to return from the grave.</p>
