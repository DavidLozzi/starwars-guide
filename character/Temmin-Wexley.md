    <p>Temmin &quot;Snap&quot; Wexley lived during the Age of the Empire and the time of the New Republic. At a young age, Temmin was separated from his parents after his father Brentin was taken away by the Galactic Empire and his mother Norra Wexley joined the Rebel Alliance. He became an independent businessman who specialized in junk dealing and rebuilt a B1-series battle droid named Mister Bones to keep him company. Following the Battle of Endor, the teenage Wexley reconciled with his mother Norra and joined forces with her to disrupt a secret Imperial meeting on the planet Akiva.</p>
