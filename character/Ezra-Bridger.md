    </p>

    <p><p>Ezra Bridger is a Force-sensitive human from the planet Lothal who rose from orphaned street thief to Jedi Padawan and key member of the Rebel Alliance’s Phoenix Cell. Trained by Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus, he constructed his own lightsaber, forged close bonds with fellow rebels Sabine Wren and Hera Syndulla, and played pivotal roles in missions to Malachor, Mandalore and the liberation of Lothal. After witnessing his master’s sacrifice, Ezra confronted Grand Admiral Thrawn, summoning space-faring purrgil to remove the Imperial officer and himself from the galaxy to save his home world. He later reemerged alongside Ahsoka Tano to continue the fight against looming threats, embodying hope and resilience amid galactic turmoil.</p></p>
