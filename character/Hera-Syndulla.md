    <p><p>Hera Syndulla is a Twi’lek pilot and commander best known as the steadfast leader of Phoenix Squadron during the early rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Daughter of freedom fighter Cham Syndulla, she captained the starship Ghost, orchestrated covert missions that expanded the Rebel Alliance’s intelligence network, and played a pivotal role in the defense of Lothal and Atollon. Earning a seat on the Rebel Alliance Council at Yavin 4 and providing crucial support for Rogue One’s mission and the Battle of Yavin, Hera’s tactical brilliance and unwavering dedication saw her rise to the rank of Admiral in the New Republic, where she continued to safeguard freedom across the galaxy.</p></p>
