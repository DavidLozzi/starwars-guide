    Max Rebo             
    </p>

    <p><p>Max Rebo is a blue-skinned Ortolan musician and leader of the Max Rebo Band, best known for providing entertainment in Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine, where his group performed the original song “Lapti Nek.” Born on the moon of Orto, he left home to pursue his passion for music and formed his band alongside drummer Droopy McCool and vocalist Sy Snootles. After winning acclaim in the Outer Rim and securing a lucrative engagement with Jabba, Rebo and his fellow musicians survived the Sarlacc pit following the Battle of Endor. In the wake of the Empire’s fall they continued performing across the galaxy, reuniting occasionally for festivals and concerts that cemented their place in galactic music history.</p></p>
