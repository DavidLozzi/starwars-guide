    <p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi is a legendary Human Jedi Master of the Galactic Republic, renowned for his skill with the lightsaber, mastery of the Force and unwavering commitment to peace and justice. Discovered as a Force-sensitive child on Stewjon, he was trained by Qui-Gon Jinn and later honed his abilities under Master Yoda. He emerged victorious against Darth Maul at the Battle of Naboo, served as a General throughout the Clone Wars and took on Anakin Skywalker as his own apprentice. After surviving the fall of the Jedi Order during Order 66, he lived in exile on Tatooine to protect young Luke Skywalker before sacrificing himself in a duel with Darth Vader aboard the Death Star. Even in death he persisted as a guiding Force spirit, shaping the future of the galaxy.</p></p>
