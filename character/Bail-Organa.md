    <p><p>Bail Prestor Organa was a Chadran-born diplomat who served as the Senator of Alderaan during the waning years of the Galactic Republic and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Renowned for his principled statesmanship and moral conviction, he secretly opposed Emperor Palpatine’s tyranny, sheltered surviving Jedi after Order 66 and helped organize the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Married to Queen Breha Antilles, he adopted Princess Leia Organa and raised her amid increasing Imperial oppression. As a key patron of the early Rebellion, he financed and provided starships like the Tantive IV, aided in the theft of the Death Star plans and ultimately perished when Alderaan was destroyed. His unwavering dedication to freedom and justice made him a foundational figure of the Rebel Alliance.</p></p>
