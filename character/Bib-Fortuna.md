    <p><p>Bib Fortuna is a Twi’lek who served as the loyal majordomo to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, known for his pale skin, lekku, and cunning demeanor. Rising from slavery to become Jabba’s right-hand aide, he managed the operations of Jabba’s palace on Tatooine and oversaw dealings with bounty hunters, smugglers, and underworld figures. Fortuna played a key role during the events of Return of the Jedi, coordinating Leia Organa’s capture and Han Solo’s carbonite imprisonment, and witnessed Jabba’s demise at the Sarlacc Pit. After Jabba’s death he briefly attempted to seize control of his master’s criminal empire before being overthrown and presumed killed, though later legends recount his survival, capture by Darth Vader on Mustafar, and ultimate unknown fate.</p></p>
