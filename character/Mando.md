    Mando (Din Djarin)             
    </p>

    <p><p>Din Djarin, known as “The Mandalorian” or “Mando,” is a lone bounty hunter of the Tribe of the Children of the Watch who rose to prominence in the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War. Renowned for his unyielding adherence to the Mandalorian creed, masterful combat abilities, and distinctive beskar armor, he became notable for rescuing and protecting a Force-sensitive foundling named Grogu. Through daring missions for Imperial remnants and the Bounty Hunters’ Guild, facing formidable adversaries like Moff Gideon, forging alliances with allies such as Cara Dune, Greef Karga, and Bo-Katan Kryze, seeking out Ahsoka Tano and entrusting Grogu’s training to Luke Skywalker, he ultimately completed a pilgrimage to Mandalore’s Living Waters to restore his honor among his people.</p></p>
