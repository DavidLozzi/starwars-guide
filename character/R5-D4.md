    R5-D4 (Red)             
    </p>

    <p><p>R5-D4 is a red-and-white astromech droid manufactured by Industrial Automaton, best known for its initially malfunctioning motivator that spared R2-D2 from sale to Owen Lars on Tatooine in 0 BBY. Over its service life R5-D4 has undertaken clandestine operations for the Alliance, assisted Biggs Darklighter in the quest to recover R2-D2, performed reconnaissance for the Tonnika Sisters, and served the Resistance under the codename “Red” during the Battle of Crait. Following the fall of the First Order, it was reassigned to Rey’s rebuilt Jedi Temple on Ahch-To, becoming a reliable companion to a new generation of Force users.</p></p>
