    Grogu (The Child)             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Grogu?year=-41" target="_blank">41 BBY</a>.
    </p>

    <p><p>Grogu, also known as “The Child” or “Baby Yoda,” is a male member of Yoda’s mysterious species renowned for his strong connection to the Force. Born on Coruscant and trained in the Jedi Temple as an infant, he survived the Purge and went into hiding for decades. In 9 ABY he was discovered and rescued by the Mandalorian Din Djarin and became the focus of a galaxy-spanning quest that revealed his remarkable healing abilities and latent power. His journey included encounters with Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett and Moff Gideon, culminating in his departure with Luke Skywalker for formal Jedi training. Grogu’s major milestones encompass surviving the fall of the Jedi, mastering Force healing, helping liberate Mandalore, and balancing his loyalty to both the Mandalorian creed and the path of the Jedi.</p></p>
