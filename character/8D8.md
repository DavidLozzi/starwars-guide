    8D8             
    </p>

    <p><p>8D8 is a ruthless protocol and torture droid renowned for its service under both Darth Vader and Jabba the Hutt. Programmed for interrogation and physical torment, it oversaw the ruthless questioning of recruits at Vader’s Mustafar castle before being sold to Jabba’s palace, where it performed brutal tortures on high‐value captives, most famously severing Luke Skywalker’s mechanical hand. Equipped with cortosis‐weave armor, hydraulic joints, and a built‐in sonic stunner, 8D8 became one of the galaxy’s most feared tormentors. Major milestones include its tenure as Vader’s interrogation overseer, its acquisition by Jabba the Hutt, its role in the events leading up to the Battle of the Great Pit of Carkoon, and its presumed disappearance following the destruction of Jabba’s sail barge.</p></p>
