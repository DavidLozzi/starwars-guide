    <p><p>Gial Ackbar was a Mon Calamari admiral and military commander renowned for his tactical brilliance and unwavering dedication to freedom. Rising from his homeworld of Mon Cala, he joined the Rebel Alliance and masterminded the assault that destroyed the second Death Star’s shield generator at the Battle of Endor. After the Galactic Empire’s fall, he led the defense of Mon Cala, helped restore its monarchy, and served as Supreme Commander of the New Republic Defense Fleet. In the New Republic era, Ackbar became a founding leader of the Resistance against the First Order, where he ultimately made the ultimate sacrifice.</p></p>
