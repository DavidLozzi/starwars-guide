    <p><p>Qui-Gon Jinn was a maverick Human Jedi Master renowned for his deep connection to the Living Force, his unorthodox approach within the Jedi Order, and his pivotal role in discovering Anakin Skywalker. Born around ~80 BBY on Coruscant, he trained under Count Dooku before rising to the rank of Jedi Knight. As a mentor to Obi-Wan Kenobi, he led critical High Republic-era peacekeeping missions and was dispatched to resolve the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo. There he encountered the young slave Anakin, believing him to be the Chosen One, and ultimately confronted Sith apprentice Darth Maul, sacrificing his life to ensure the Republic’s survival. Even after his death, Qui-Gon’s influence endured through Force-ghost appearances and teachings preserved in Jedi lore.</p></p>
