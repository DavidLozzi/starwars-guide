    Snoke     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Snoke?year=4" target="_blank">4 ABY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Snoke?year=34" target="_blank">34 ABY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p><p>Snoke is a mysterious Force-sensitive being who rose to become Supreme Leader of the First Order, known for seducing Ben Solo to the dark side and orchestrating the destruction of the New Republic. Created and nurtured in secret by Emperor Palpatine through Sith alchemy as a living strandcast of Dark Side energy, Snoke emerged from the Unknown Regions to unite ex-Imperial remnants and oversee the Starkiller Base attack on Hosnian Prime. His ruthless command saw the formation of the Knights of Ren and the Praetorian Guard, but after manipulating and training Kylo Ren, he was betrayed and killed by his apprentice, only to be later revealed as a mere puppet in Palpatine’s grand design.</p></p>
