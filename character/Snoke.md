    Snoke     was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Snoke?year=4" target="_blank">4 ABY</a> and died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Snoke?year=34" target="_blank">34 ABY</a>.        
    </p>

    <p>Snoke ruled the First Order as Supreme Leader during the New Republic Era. Possibly unaware of his true nature, Snoke was an artificial genetic construct created on the planet Exegol by the resurrected Dark Lord of the Sith and former Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. Cloned from Sidious with various genetic sciences, Snoke was designed to be a proxy that the Sith Lord could manipulate, though he possessed an independent mind and free will.</p>
