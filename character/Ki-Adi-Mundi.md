    </p>

    <p><p>Ki-Adi Mundi was a distinguished Cerean Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. Known for his calm wisdom, distinctive conical skull, and strategic brilliance, he rose from Jedi Initiate to Council member under Master Arligan Zey, championing both Jedi ideals and the interests of his homeworld, Cerea. He led Republic forces in key engagements—Geonosis, Christophsis and the Umbara campaign—served as a Galactic Senate representative, and challenged aspects of Jedi dogma to protect his family. Ultimately, he fell during Order 66 on the ice world of Mygeeto in 19 BBY, one of many Jedi lost in the Republic’s collapse.</p></p>
