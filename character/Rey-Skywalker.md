    Rey Skywalker             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Rey Skywalker?year=15" target="_blank">15 ABY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Rey was a Jedi Master who fought on the side of the Resistance in the war against the First Order. A former scavenger from the planet Jakku, her life was changed by the tumultuous events of the last days of the New Republic Era. Her decision to help the droid BB-8 would set Rey on a course to discovering the Force that awakened within her, leading her to seek out Jedi Master Luke Skywalker for training. Yet despite her commitment to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force, Rey felt the pull to the dark side due to her anger and the adversarial relationship she had with Ben Solo, a fallen Jedi whom she knew as the dark warrior Kylo Ren. The unique Force-bond between them was a result of their nature as a dyad in the Force. Rey was born a Palpatine, but would take the name of Skywalker, after her masters.</p>
