    General Grievous (Qymaen jai Sheelal)         died in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/General Grievous?year=-19" target="_blank">19 BBY</a>.    
    </p>

    <p><p>General Grievous, born Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a fearsome Kaleesh warlord turned cyborg commander of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Trained in lightsaber combat by Count Dooku, he became infamous for collecting the lightsabers of fallen Jedi and for his brutal tactics against the Republic. Grievous led countless engagements—most notably the Battle of Geonosis, the massacre of Jedi younglings aboard the Invisible Hand, and the klaxons of Coruscant—before meeting his end at the hands of Obi-Wan Kenobi on Utapau. His transformation into a half-machine general and his relentless pursuit of Jedi made him one of the most notorious figures of the war.</p>
