    <p>Grievous, born as Qymaen jai Sheelal, was a warlord who served as a commanding officer within the military forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Despite his position as a general, Grievous held the title of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Army that engaged the Grand Army of the Republic in the pan-galactic Clone Wars. Noted for being ruthless and his extensive cybernetic enhancements, Grievous instilled fear throughout the entire galaxy as he traveled, invading planets and engaging the Jedi Knights of the Republic.</p>
