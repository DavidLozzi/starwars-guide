    </p>

    <p><p>Finn, originally designated FN-2187, is a former First Order stormtrooper who became a key hero of the Resistance in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Known for refusing to fire on innocent civilians during an assignment on Jakku, he deserted his trainers, saved Poe Dameron, and crash-landed alongside Rey and the droid BB-8. Adopting the name Finn, he fought in pivotal battles against the First Order including the destruction of Starkiller Base, the Battle of Crait, and the climactic Battle of Exegol. Through these milestones, he forged deep alliances, discovered courage and purpose beyond his stormtrooper past, and helped restore balance to the galaxy.</p></p>
