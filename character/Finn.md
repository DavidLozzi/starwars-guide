    Finn (FN-2187)             was born in <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Finn?year=11" target="_blank">11 ABY</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Finn, formerly designated FN-2187 (&quot;Eight-Seven&quot;), was a  stormtrooper who served the First Order until his desertion and subsequent defection to the Resistance during the First Order/Resistance War. Though trained since birth to be a loyal and obedient soldier, FN-2187's conscience conflicted with the methods of the First Order. For a time he was unwilling to support the Resistance, hoping to escape the galactic conflict instead of fighting for a cause he believed was doomed to fail. As the galaxy became consumed by war, the renegade trooper was ultimately forced to decide where his true loyalties lay.</p>
