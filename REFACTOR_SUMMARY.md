# Tailwind CSS Refactoring Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ **Tailwind CSS Integration**
- Installed Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 and @tailwindcss/typography plugin
- Created `tailwind.config.js` with custom Star Wars theme configuration
- Set up build pipeline with npm scripts for CSS compilation
- Added custom breakpoint for navigation at 1000px

### ✅ **Custom Star Wars Theme**
Created a consistent color palette with SW- prefixed naming:
- `sw-black` / `sw-white` - Primary colors
- `sw-red-400` / `sw-yellow-400` / `sw-blue-400` / `sw-green-400` - Accent colors  
- `sw-pink-400` / `sw-orange-400` - Social media colors

### ✅ **File Organization & Cleanup**
- Created new `src/input.css` as the main Tailwind input file
- Moved from `assets/css/lozzi.scss` to `assets/css/main.css` (built output)
- Added legacy SCSS documentation in `_sass/README.md`
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts
- Removed old CSS entry point file

### ✅ **Template Refactoring**
Updated all layout and include files to use new Tailwind classes:

**Layouts Updated:**
- `_layouts/home.html` - Main layout linking to new CSS
- `_layouts/page.html` - Content pages
- `_layouts/posts.html` - Blog posts layout  
- `_layouts/character.html` - Character pages

**Includes Updated:**
- `_includes/header.html` - Navigation and ASCII art
- `_includes/footer.html` - Footer social links

**Pages Updated:**
- `index.markdown` - Home page with app cards, raffle promo, social links, news section

### ✅ **Component System**
Migrated custom components to Tailwind @layer components:
- `.card` - Main card component with color variants
- `.btn` - Button styles with hover effects
- `.news-item` - News article cards
- `.social-link` - Social media links
- `.separator` - Decorative breaks
- `.quote-section` - Quote display area

### ✅ **Development Workflow**
- `npm run dev` - Development with CSS watching
- `npm run build` - Production build with minified CSS
- `npm run build:css` / `npm run build:css-prod` - CSS-only builds

### ✅ **Documentation**
- Updated `README.md` with new tech stack and development instructions
- Added `AGENTS.md` learnings about the Tailwind setup
- Created `_sass/README.md` explaining legacy file status
- Documented Star Wars color system and component usage

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Maintainability**: Standard Tailwind classes instead of custom utility classes
2. **Consistency**: Centralized color system with SW- prefixed theme
3. **Performance**: Tree-shaking and CSS purging with Tailwind
4. **Developer Experience**: IntelliSense support and better tooling
5. **Future-Proof**: Industry standard CSS framework
6. **Responsive Design**: Better responsive utilities while maintaining custom 1000px nav breakpoint

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Jekyll 4.3.2 + Tailwind CSS 3.4.0
- **Font**: JetBrains Mono (imported via Google Fonts)
- **Build Output**: ~41KB CSS file (built from Tailwind + custom components)
- **Custom Breakpoint**: `nav: '1000px'` for hamburger menu behavior
- **Color System**: HSL-based with CSS custom properties support

## Legacy Code Preserved

- All original SCSS files preserved in `_sass/` for reference
- Custom utility classes documented for future migration reference
- Navigation responsive behavior maintained exactly as before

## Next Steps

- Monitor site performance with new CSS build
- Consider additional Tailwind plugins if needed
- Optimize further with CSS purging for production
- Document any site-specific Tailwind patterns for team reference

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Site successfully refactored to use Tailwind CSS with full feature parity and improved maintainability.
