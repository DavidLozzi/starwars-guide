In this story arc spanning books 1-3, **Light and Life**, we start off seeing Yoda exiled on Dagobah, being harrassed by a force voice, and remembering back to the days of The High Republic. This story takes us through a high adventure of two new species, the peaceful Scalvi and the warring Crulcon. Who survives? Why is Yoda remembering this, and how does it lead into A New Hope?! Watch and see!
