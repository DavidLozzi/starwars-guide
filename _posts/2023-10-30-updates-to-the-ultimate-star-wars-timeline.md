Excited to share our padawans have created some great updates to [The Ultimate Star Wars Timeline](https://timeline.starwars.guide)!



## Marking the Passing of Legends
Regrettably, we've had to bid farewell to numerous iconic heroes and villains over the years. To commemorate their legacy, we now display a small skull symbol (ðŸ’€) next to the year they passed away. Moreover, as you scroll down the timeline, characters who are no longer with us will still appear on the screen, with their age continuing to advance.

For instance, had they lived, Qui-Gon and Mace would have celebrated their 71st year in the era of Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi! You can explore more about them <a href="https://timeline.starwars.guide/character/Qui-Gon%20Jinn?year=-9" target="_blank">here</a>.


## Swift Character Search
If you are using a desktop or laptop browser, you can quickly find a specific character by clicking on "Find by Character" in the top right corner and selecting your character of choice.

On your mobile device, you can access this feature by tapping the search button in the upper right corner and then selecting "Select Character."

## Other Noteworthy Updates
We have also made some minor data updates, such as including Maul in "Solo: A Star Wars Story." You can stay updated with our latest changes by following us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/UltStarWarsTime" target="_blank">@UltStarWarsTime</a>.
